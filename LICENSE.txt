This framework is free to use and adapt for personal or professional non-commercial purposes,
provided that the following conditions are met:

1. The Base Adaptive Communication Model v1.2 – Adaptive Communication Project is a protected framework.
   Its core structure, tone system, and communication protocols must remain unchanged in all derivative versions.

2. Users may create sub-versions (for example, v1.2.1, v1.2.2) for personal or accessibility adaptations.
   These sub-versions must clearly state:
   “Based on the Adaptive Communication Model v1.2 – Adaptive Communication Project.”

3. Users may not publish or distribute major version updates (v1.3 or higher) unless granted explicit permission from the original author.

4. The framework may not be used commercially, sold, or monetized in any form without written consent.

5. The intent of this model is not for profit. Its sole purpose is to improve accessibility,

6. Any attempt to use or adapt this model for financial gain, paywalled access, or exclusive distribution
   directly violates the spirit and purpose of the Adaptive Communication Project.

Integrity Statement:
The base version (v1.2) of this framework is protected. Others may create personal adaptations
but may not structurally alter or redistribute the core protocols, nor use them for profit,
without explicit consent from the original author.
