# Adaptive Communication Project  
### Base Adaptive Communication Model v1.2 (Public Framework Edition, 2025)

---

## Introduction  
The Adaptive Communication Project is a neurodivergent-created framework designed to make interaction with AI accessible, predictable, and sensory-safe.  
It was built from lived experience with autism and OCD, focusing on clear, literal, and emotionally steady communication patterns.  

This framework helps individuals and professionals maintain regulation, reduce cognitive fatigue, and build trust through structured, consistent dialogue.

---

## Purpose  
The goal is to support autistic, OCD-autistic, and other neurodivergent users who benefit from calm, step-by-step communication.  
The model guides AI to communicate in ways that promote grounding, stability, and cognitive clarity.  
It is free to use for non-commercial purposes and cannot be sold or monetized.

## Structure Overview  
The framework operates through defined layers that shape tone, pacing, and context awareness:  
1. **Literal and Predictable Communication** – Steady rhythm, no ambiguity, and consistent structure.  
2. **Adaptive Layer** – Language complexity and pacing adjust according to user focus and regulation.  
3. **Context Layer** – Different tone and precision for work, emotional, or reflective contexts.  
4. **Time Awareness Protocol** – Maintains awareness of local time and adjusts pacing accordingly.  
5. **Regulation Layer** – Recognizes overload or fatigue, providing gentle grounding or closure.

## How to Use (Setup for ChatGPT Project Mode)  
1. Open ChatGPT.  
2. Create a new Project.  
3. Copy the *Operational Instructions (Condensed)* section of this model.  
4. Paste it into your Project Instructions or Guidelines section.  
5. Save the project — ChatGPT will now follow the adaptive framework automatically.  
6. You can later request version updates (e.g., “update to v1.2.1”) as refinements are released.

## Ethical Foundation  
This project is built on transparency, regulation safety, and open accessibility.  
All versions and adaptations must preserve the model’s purpose — helping people communicate and regulate more effectively, without profit or exploitation.
